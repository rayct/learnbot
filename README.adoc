= Chatbot Program

This is a simple chatbot program written in Python. The chatbot is designed to interact with users, answer questions, and learn new responses based on user input. It includes features such as logging, knowledge base management, grammar and spell checking, and more.

== Features

=== 1. Chatbot Interaction

- The chatbot interacts with users through a command line interface.
- Users can ask questions or provide input, and the chatbot responds accordingly.
- The chatbot uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand user input and find the best match in its knowledge base.

=== 2. Knowledge Base Management

- The chatbot stores its knowledge base in a JSON file (`knowledge_base.json`).
- Users can reload the knowledge base, add new questions and answers, and save the updated knowledge base.

=== 3. Logging

- The chatbot logs interactions and errors to a text file (`chatbot.log`).
- Log entries include timestamps, log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL), and messages.

=== 4. Rebooting

- Users can initiate a reboot of the chatbot program.
- During a reboot, the chatbot logs the reboot process and reloads the script.

=== 5. Grammar and Spell Checking

- The chatbot performs grammar and spell checking on user input and responses.
- It uses the Enchant library to check for spelling errors and suggest corrections.

=== 6. Clearing the Log File

- Users can clear the log file by typing `clear log` in the command line interface.
- This feature helps maintain log files and keep them from growing too large.

== Usage
