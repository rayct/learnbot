* Clean exit logging
* `Reload` feature
* `Reboot` feature added
* `Quit` feature added

* Explanation of Logging Integration:

* Logging Configuration:
    * logging.basicConfig is used to configure the logging settings, specifying the log file name, log level, format, and date format.

* Logging Messages:
    * Info Level:
        * Successfully loading the knowledge base.
        * Successfully saving the knowledge base.
        * Finding the best match for the user question.
        * Adding a new answer to the knowledge base.
        * Responding with an answer.
    * Error Level:
        * Errors while loading or saving the knowledge base.
    * Warning Level:
        * No answer found for the matched question.
        * No match found for the user question.
    * Session End:
        * Logging when the user ends the chatbot session.

* Try-Except in get_user_input: The get_user_input function is wrapped in a try-except block to catch KeyboardInterrupt and log it.

* Try-Except in chat_bot Loop: The main loop in chat_bot is wrapped in a try-except block to catch KeyboardInterrupt and log it, allowing the program to exit gracefully.

* Top-Level Try-Except: The top-level execution of chat_bot is wrapped in a try-except block to catch any other unexpected exceptions and log them as critical errors.

* Chatbot will now support reloading the knowledge base on-the-fly by typing `reload`, in addition to handling exits and logging various actions and errors.
